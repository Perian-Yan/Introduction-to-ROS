# Introduction-to-ROS
## Overview

These are the exercises from the course [Programming for Robotics - ROS](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) at ETH Zurich, FS2023

This course provides an introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS) including:

- Creating ROS packages
- Creating nodes, publishing and subscribing topics
- Writing Service Servers and Clients
- Simulating with Gazebo
- Visualizing in RViz (LidarScan, PointCloud, Marker, TF)
- Working with ROS bag

I learned how to create software including simulation, to interface sensors and actuators, and to integrate control algorithms.
